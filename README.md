## Caterham 3D Upgrades

This repository contains 3D files ready to be 3D printed and can be used to modify your Caterham 7. 

This aims to share my work and love with others and involve the Caterham community in the open source. 

Here's a picture of my Caterham 340R in the wild.

## Projects

### Side mirrors
This project shares 3D files for improvements to the side mirrors. A new mount that mounts to the door hinges offers very rigid mirror mounting and eliminates shaking when driving. 

**Printing**
The STL files are included if you want to make any changes to the model. The models are still evolving based on the learning from the usage. 
The mesh (.3mf) files can be imported into any slicing software in preparation for 3D printing.

I've provided a sliced version of the model, that uses PETG material and was sliced for [Prusa mk3s 3d printer](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer-3/).
PETG material is suggested and has been tested by me with good results so far. PLA is not acceptable as it will melt under hot temperatures and doesn't handle UV radiation well.

After the hinges are printed you should spray paint them in black to match the doors. They should look something like this:

**Mounting**
Mounting these hinges requires you to dismount the current mirrors and mount the hinges through one of the holes the current mirrors used. 

The mirrors used for this hinge are SPA mirrors and can be ordered here (shipping to EU as well): https://www.merlinmotorsport.co.uk/s/mirrors/spa-mirrors/spa-formula-and-caterham-mirrors

You will need to replace the screws with slightly longer ones, my advice is to go to a hardware store, buy M5 screws, and cut them to the desired length. Ideally, you can spray paint them to black.

Mounting should be easy, you just need to swap out the brass stick from the existing hinge and put it in the new hinge.

Mounted mirrors should look something like this:

Heavily inspired by this project, where if you don't own a 3D printer and live in UK you can order them directly from:
https://uberniche.co.uk/mirror-mounts.html

And a bit different concept (in my opinion not as good):
