## Caterham 3D Upgrades

This repository contains 3D files ready to be 3D printed and can be used to modify your Caterham 7. 

This aims to share my work and love with others and involve the Caterham community in the open source. 

Here's a picture of my Caterham 340R in the wild.

## Projects

### Side mirrors
This project shares 3D files for improvements to the side mirrors. A new mount that mounts to the door hinges offers very rigid mirror mounting and eliminates shaking when driving.
